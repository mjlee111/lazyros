## Getting started

1. Run talker demo node
   ```shell
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
   ```

2. Run listener demo node
   ```
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
   ```

3. Run lazyros
   ```shell
   lazyros
   ```

## Configuration

You can tell lazyros to ignore specific nodes, topics, or parameters by creating a file:
```sh
~/.config/lazyros/ignore.yaml
```
If this file doesnâ€™t exist, lazyros will just run normally.

Example:
```bash
nodes:
  - /lazyros*
topics:
  - /parameter_events
parameters:
  - /lazyros*
```
